# 🩺 ASR Medical Noun Enhancement: A Hybrid NLP Approach

This project develops a specialized **hybrid spell correction system** for enhancing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs in the **medical domain**. It is designed to accurately correct misspelled **medication names** and **medical terminology**, which are common points of failure for general ASR models.

The project was developed in a series of **Jupyter notebooks**, documenting a step-by-step approach from data analysis to a robust hybrid model architecture.

## 📚 Problem Statement

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems often struggle with **proper nouns** and **domain-specific vocabulary**.  
In the context of **medical conversations**, this can lead to **critical transcription errors** in medication names and medical terminology.

**Goal:** Build a **spell correction system** that specifically targets these noun-related errors, transforming incorrect ASR output into **accurate, clinically useful text**.

## 🚀 The Hybrid Pipeline

The final solution is a **multi-stage pipeline** that combines the strengths of different NLP architectures:

1. **T5 Model (Generative Correction)**
   - Fine-tuned **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** model for end-to-end correction.
   - Handles a wide range of ASR errors: phonetic substitutions, segmentation issues, etc.
   - Uses a **Noun-Weighted Loss** to prioritize accuracy of critical medical terms.

2. **BERT Model (Contextual Post-Processing)**
   - **PubMedBERT**, a pre-trained BERT with deep medical domain knowledge.
   - Acts as a **second-pass correction** for remaining single-word noun/medical errors.
   - Leverages **contextual understanding** to fill in masked words.

3. **Dictionary Correction (Final Cleanup)**
   - Rule-based dictionary of **medication names** and **medical terms**.
   - Provides **deterministic corrections** for high-confidence known errors.
   - Ensures a **safety net** for the most crucial terms.

## 📊 Key Results

The hybrid approach demonstrated significant improvements over traditional baselines:

- **Word Accuracy** → Percentage of words correctly transcribed.  
- **Noun Accuracy** → Specialized metric for medical nouns/terms.  
- **BLEU Score** → Measures fluency and sentence-level quality.
